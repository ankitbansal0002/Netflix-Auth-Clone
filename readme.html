Tmdb for movie database
// ankitbansal0182@gmail.com // Havkii@#120
// tmdb : https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
// d23c79adf6711f69a383956e72bef957
// https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=d23c79adf6711f69a383956e72bef957

node module cd node_module_name
npm start

step 1: remove the basic app.js logo of react
step 2: lets create a request.js to access tmdb website (learn about api key and export default) refer # https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-export-default-in-javascript/

step 3:Since we have installed the axios using # npx i axios {feature of axios : https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios} now we will import it into a js file
step 4: create a axios file

step 5: we will create a row js file bcz now want different categories in diff rows
                Few Mini-Steps-1 : Firstly use rfce it will same time react function and export
                                2 : Now we will link row to app.js using props and import ofcourse (# { title } == we call it container )
                                        1: Here link is made through import and export  
                                        2: props help you to link the components 

step 6: See their are few little concept need to revise : usestate, useeffect, props, hooks                                         

Step 7: Priority Ranking -:  index.js/index.css <- app.js/app.css 
                                                        <- {will have different components} like 
                                                                <- rows.js/rows.css 
                                                                        <- navbar.js/navbar.css
        Note : Request.js / Axios.js will be like general js files and to be used in many other js files.

Step 8: create the different components navbar where you learn about how to add a class only while scrolling

step 9: create a banner which will help you to understand again the use of useEffect and usestate

step 10: we will create youtube trailer popup :-> for that we will need 2 packages ( 1 ) npm i react-yotube  (2) npm i movie-trailer
        
        now we will include Youtube tag into the html frame and include some attributes 
        we will also write a nice if and else statement to understand the use of promise and -> URL and URLSearchParam objects

Step 11: Now everything seems to be done now we will deploy it on firebase
                Following Steps to be followed :
                        1) check firebase login : firebase login
                        2) initialize firebase : firebase init
                        3) Answer Questions : select hosting -> select existing project -> select the name 
                                                        -> type { build } -> y and -> n
                        4) now it will create a build folder
                        5) To push all data in it we use : npm run build
                        5) last command : firebase deploy       
                        
                Steps to push changes to firebase: 
                        1) npm run build
                        2) firebase deploy        
   
Step Last : Update the title and logo in public folder

Now We will learn authentications : 

Step 1: Install 2 npm packages :-> 1) npm add firebase  
                                        2) npm add react-router-dom  (in their use 
                                        import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
                                                router -> routes -> route path - > element = {} 
                                                )
         used in App.js                                       

Step 2: We created 2 pages LoginPage which is then open SignIn or SignUp page

step 3: how we can be on same page but switch between signup and SignIn

step 4: creating firebase authentications V9

        firebase.js -> auth and app creation
        context folder -> AuthContext : learn about createContext & useContext vs props 
                                creating create user, login logout and creating a provider
                                attach this js file to signup signin
        
        SignUp : use onChange in input and usestate to take their values and pass it to var                        
                 import userAuth context and use it createUser Function and then create a 
                        handleOnclick function as async function and pass email and password values and also create try and catch
        
        SignIn : use sigIn function from userAuth and pass same email and password
        
        ProtectedAuth : it will stop anybody to access homepage directly and redirct to ur defiend page only logged in user can access link it to app.js

        Logout: use logout function of userAuth and logout via a click
